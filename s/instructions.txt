Welcome to devboot-amiga (v0.2, 23.02.2019)
===========================================
This is an AROS shell with reqtools patch, so hit <TAB> 
for filename-completion and file-requester

To run a production do as follows:
- cd to the desired directory (e.g. "cd wip:amiga/demo/myeffect") 
- type "j" <ENTER> to run it

To manage your directories:
- type "cd" to see where you are
- type "cdd" to save your current demo directory for later use
- type "cb" to go back to the saved dir
- type "dopus" for file-management

Have fun!
 - Noname
