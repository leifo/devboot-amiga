I have had enough of this Amiga OS legal mumbo-jumbo. 

This is a heavily stripped-down version of AROS, a free and open-source Amiga OS 3.1 compatible replacement OS.

If you don't have the Amiga OS files, you can use this to boot an emulated Amiga in WinUAE and start stuff from shell.

This can be used together with our haujobb-amiga toolchain.
