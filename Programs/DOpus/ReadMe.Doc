This File contains features and changes made to Directory OPUS version 4.12
that are not reflected in the printed manual. If you are just getting
started, you may not be too concerned with this information yet. However,
there are a couple of new options in the Configuration Program which do not
appear in your printed manual. These comments assume some familiarity with
using Directory OPUS and its configuration utility.

KNOWN OPERATING SYSTEM BUGS

Commodore has known problems with Soft and Hard links.  Do not be surprised
 if the links come up with wrong file information.  Most of these problems
 are due to ExAll() and Ram:.  Commodore is working on fixes for these
 problems.  If you don't know what links are then you don't use them, so
 don't worry, be happy.
 
===============================================================================

Version 4.12

===============================================================================
 
New command sequence : {Q}
--------------------------

    {Q<type>}

    Inserts a queried value from Directory Opus.
    
        {Qs} = public screen name that Directory Opus is on
        {Qp} = rexx port name used by Directory Opus
        {Qr} = rexx result of the last internal command

    Example :
        AmigaDOS  Echo We are on screen : "{Qs}"
        AmigaDOS  Echo Our rexx port name is : "{Qp}"
        Command   FinishSection
        Command   Query ViewPlayFlags
        AmigaDOS  Echo View play flags are : {Qr}

===============================================================================

New/Changes Modify/Query Command options
----------------------------------------
	ScreenName                   - Query the name of the screen that Directory
	                               Opus is open on.  This may be workbench if
	                               Opus is iconified. QUERY ONLY

	PortName <name>              - The name of the rexx port used by
	                               Directory Opus. MODIFY & QUERY
	                               
===============================================================================

Version 4.11

===============================================================================

New Shortcut keys
-----------------

The following shortcut keys have been added:

        Shift-Return        Displays the Buffer List in the current window.
        Alt-Return          Displays the Device List in the current window.
        LAmiga-Space        Scrolls to first selected file
        RAmiga-Space        Scrolls to first selected directory
        ]                   Displays the next gadget bank
        [                   Displays the previous gadget bank


Furthermore, when showing a list of pictures, the Return key will proceed to
the next picture.

===============================================================================

Skip All while Searching
------------------------

When a text string is found while searching multiple files, a requester
appears asking you if you want to read the file. A "Skip all" button has
been added. Selecting this button continues searching the selected files
without bringing up this requester. As a result, the files containing the
search text will remain highlighted, files which do not contain the search
text will be deselected. At this point you can do some other operation on
the selected files (the ones containing the text). For example, this is a
great way to copy files which contain some text string.

===============================================================================

Choosing the Parent of your Choice
----------------------------------

You can now bring up a requester which shows all the Parent Directories for
the current directory. Simply double-click on the current directory's
Diskname bar. Selecting an entry and clicking Okay, or double-clicking an
entry will read the selected directory.

Also, if the current directory, or any of its parent directories have
multi-volume assigns (see your AmigaDos documentation), these will be
displayed in the list as well.

See also: ParentList command below

===============================================================================

File Name completion
--------------------

If you are editing the Directory Field for a Directory Window, and you are
going to type the name of a sub-directory - you can save a few keystrokes by
starting the name and press the Help key. Directory Opus will fill out the
subdirectory name with the first name which starts with the name you filled
in. Subsequent presses of the Help key will cycle through all matching
directory names.

===============================================================================

Using Workbench Iconify Window as a File Viewer
-----------------------------------------------

You can drop Workbench Icons on Directory OPUS's Iconified Window bar to
view the file. OPUS will view the file in the same manner as a double-click
from Directory OPUS's main window. In other words, a Picture is shown, a
Text file brings up OPUS's text viewer, etc.

===============================================================================

Directory Opus now supports ANIM7 and ANIM8 formats

===============================================================================

Running Format, Diskcopy, Install, and Info requester from a Shell
------------------------------------------------------------------

You can run OPUS's Format, Disk Copy, and Install requesters directly from
an Amiga Dos prompt without going through Directory OPUS. All three are
contained in the program DOpus:modules/DOpus_Disk.

You select between the three by giving a command argument of F for Format, D
for Disk Copy, and I for Install. For example:

    >DOpus_Disk F         ;Brings up Format
    >DOpus_Disk D         ;Disk Copy
    >DOpus_Disk I         ;Install

These can also be started from the Workbench; see below for the required
Tooltypes.

You can also run OPUS's Icon information requester directly by running the
program DOpus:modules/DOpus_Icon. It needs a filename as an argument. The
".info" on the end is optional.

    >DOpus_Icon sys:prefs.info
    >DOpus_Icon sys:prefs

===============================================================================

Tooltypes and Command Arguments
-------------------------------

The following Tooltypes and command arguments are supported:

  Directory Opus

    Tooltypes           Command Argument
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ICONSTART               -i             Start iconified
    BUTTONSTART             -b             Start button-iconified
    CONFIGFILE              -c             Specify new configuration filename
    CHECK                   -g             Check if Opus is already running

  DOpus_Disk

    OPERATION=Format        f              Format
    OPERATION=Diskcopy      d              Diskcopy
    OPERATION=Install       i              Install

===============================================================================

Save Button is back
-------------------

The "Save" Button on ConfigOpus's main screen, which was removed in version
4.0, is back. Clicking this button saves the configuration without bringing
up the file requester.

===============================================================================

Help Button is gone
-------------------

The help button, which was represented by a "?", has been removed from the
ConfigOpus screens. The Help key still displays the help for the current
screen.

===============================================================================

Display Copy Progress Indicator
-------------------------------

You can now have Directory OPUS display a Copy Progress Indicator, a bar
which shows how much of a file has been copied or moved. This option has
been added to the "Operation/Update" Editor in Config OPUS. This is
especially useful when copying large files.

The Progress indicator will appear when using the Copy, CopyTo, Move,
MoveTo, Clone, and Encrypt operations.

===============================================================================

Drop Icon change
----------------

If you are running AmigaDos 3.0, ConfigOpus will open on the Workbench
screen if possible. When it does this, the AppIcon (described on p. 91) will
not appear on the Workbench screen. Instead, drop the Icons directly on the
editor Window.

===============================================================================

Paint Mode
----------

In the Buttons, Menus, and Drives editor screens, there is a new menu called
"Tools" with a menu item called "Paint mode". Paint mode allows you to
easily set the colors of many items without bringing up the editor for each
of them.

Selecting the "Paint Mode" menu item brings up a requester which allows you
to select the Foreground and Background colors you want to paint with. When
you select Okay, the title on the Editor will contain the text "(Paint Mode
Active)" and the "Paint Mode" menu will have a checkmark next to it. When
you click on a Button in the Button Editor, the button will be painted with
the selected colors (the Menu and Drives editors work in similar manner).
You can click on as many buttons as you wish to paint. When you are done
painting with these colors, select the "Paint Mode" menu item again. This
will turn off Paint Mode. If you want to paint with some other colors,
simply select the menu item "Paint Mode" again to restart the process.

===============================================================================

New options in Screen/General
-----------------------------

'Display status text in title bar'
    
      This removed the status bar at the top of Directory OPUS's main window
      and uses the the title bar for status messages. This gives you a
      little more room for viewing files.

'New-look menus' (Only for AmigaDos 3.0 and later) 

      Uses the new-look black on white menus. With this flag enabled, any
      menu items that use the default colors of 0 on 1 will be automatically
      mapped to 1 on 2.

'Custom screen window borders'

      Turns on the new Window look described below.

===============================================================================

New Window Look
---------------

Starting with AmigaDos version 2.0 Commodore established user interface
style guide standards. The purpose of these standards is to provide Amiga
owners a consistant interface for the various programs they are using. We
strongly believe in this philosophy and are continuously evaluating our
products in regard to this standard.

As a result, some changes have been made to Directory OPUS. Primarily,
Directory OPUS, and Config OPUS now have a slightly different look. For
those who are interested in such details, OPUS used to open a borderless,
backdrop window when open on a custom screen. Now, when the 'Custom screen
window borders' flag is selected, or Directory OPUS is open on the Workbench
or another public screen, it now opens a window with OS-supplied borders,
Close, Zoom (under 2.0) and Depth buttons.

As a result, it has real window borders. It also means the Depth button in
the upper right corner is a Window Depth Button. Before it was a Screen
Depth Button. Window Depth Buttons arrange Windows on a screen, Screen Depth
Buttons arrange the screens.

If you click on the Window Depth Button and Directory Opus does not push to
the back, don't be alarmed. Below, we will tell you how to resize the
Directory Opus Window to get access to the Screen Button.

We also added an invisible Window Size Button in the lower right corner.
When you click on the border in this corner you can resize the OPUS window.

To resize the OPUS window to give you access to the Screen Depth button,
perform the following steps.

    - Click on the Window Size Button on the window border in the lower
      right corner and move the mouse pointer up an inch or so.
      This will give you room to move the Window down.
    - Click on the Window Drag bar, at the top of the OPUS window,
      drag it down.  When you release window, the Screen Title Bar and its
      Depth button will be exposed.  
    - Using the same Window Drag bar, position the window so you can 
      see as much of the Screen Title Bar as you wish.
    - Finally, using the Window Size Button, in the lower right corner,
      drag the bottom of the window as far as it will go down and to the
      right.

Remember, to save the Window position and size, go to ConfigOpus and save
the configuration. It will save the current window settings.

===============================================================================

Open Directory OPUS on a Public Screen
--------------------------------------

The Display Mode list in the "Screen/Screen Mode" editor in ConfigOpus will
include any Public Screens allowing you to open OPUS on the selected screen.

===============================================================================

Screen/Sliders Editor
---------------------

There is a new editor in the Screen configuration called Sliders.

This editor allows you to select the position of the Window View Sliders.
Simply click on the buttons above the simulated window views to toggle them
between Right and Left.

===============================================================================

The SHAM is back
----------------

The controversial SHAM picture is once again handled by OPUS's picture
displayer. This mode, while unsupported by Commodore, has some popularity.
We removed it in Version 4.0 because of its unstable nature. We could not
get it to work with all SHAM pictures and Commodore refuses to give support
to this rogue format. As a result, we do not guarantee it will work. With
all that said, our SHAM viewer does work with most SHAM and now also PCHG
pictures. Invalid SHAM pictures may still cause problems.

===============================================================================

FileClass Move & MoveTo now accepts $ hex values
------------------------------------------------

The Move and MoveTo operations in FileClass identification now accepts Hex
values which are proceeded by a '$' character.

Example:
    MoveTo   $100                - Moves to the 256'th byte in the file

===============================================================================

New/Changes Modify/Query Command options
----------------------------------------
    PubScreen <name>             - Open up onto public screen
                                   (you also need to set ScreenMode to 3 for
                                    public screen and do a Redraw)
                                    
    ViewPlayFlags 64             - The pick best screen-mode flag
    
    WindowWH <w> <h>             - Change window size (immediately)
    
    WindowXY <x> <y>             - Change window position (immediately)
    
    WindowXYWH <x> <y> <w> <h>   - Change position and size (immediately)
                                   (this only works under 2.04 or greater)
                                   
===============================================================================

New command : SetVar
--------------------

    SetVar <name> <value>

    Sets the specified local environment variable to the given value.
    
    Return codes :
        RC=0     Success
        RC=10    Attempted under 1.3 (only works under 2.0)
        RC=20    Incorrect arguments given
        RC=30    Failed
    Result=undefined


New command : Notify
--------------------

    Notify <text>

    Opens a simply notification requester. This requester has a single
    continue button. The text will be word wrapped into the requester.
    
    Return codes :
        RC=0     Success
    Result=undefined
    

New command : ParentList
------------------------

    ParentList [<window>]

    Bring up a requester which shows all the Parent Directories for the
    current directory. Selecting an entry and clicking Okay, or
    double-clicking an entry will read in the selected directory.

    If the current directory uses multi-volume assigns (see your AmigaDos
    documentation), these will be displayed in the list as well.
    
    If window is not give the list will be based on the current window.
    (-1 = current window, 0 = left window or 1 = right, defaults to -1)
    
    Return codes :
        RC=0     Success
    Result=undefined

===============================================================================

New command sequence : {v}
--------------------------

    {v<name>}

    Inserts value of named variable in command string.

    Example :
        Command   SetVar testvar {RsEnter something}
        AmigaDOS  Echo You typed : "{vtestvar}"
   
===============================================================================

Documentation for those who have tried to use AddCustHandler
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the ARexx arguments which get passed to a Custom Handler

    Arg0 - Operation type   (1=Double-click, 2=Click-m-click)

    Arg1 - Entry number     (This is the ordinal number of the selected
                             entry. Note that this number is assigned in the
                             order that the entries are added; if an entry
                             is not added at the end of the list, this
                             number will not correctly reflect its position
                             in the list)

    Arg2 - Entry text       (This returns the text for this entry)

    Arg3 - Userdata         (This is the user-assigned data for this entry.
                             We suggest that you possibly use this value for
                             keeping track of entries rather than the Entry
                             number returned in Arg1).
